**About**

Over the course of two weeks, I had the opportunity to come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of my choice or to come up with a problem where I could use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem. No matter what I've decided to do, I had to make sure to provide sufficient justification of why I thought what I wanted to do or solve was important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in my project.

I've learned about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. I now Know how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. I've also learned how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. By utilizing Python and its libraries to manipulate data, I was able to refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data.
